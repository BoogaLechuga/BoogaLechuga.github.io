        <p id="end">
            In 1987, I placed 7th at the United States Intercollegiate Archery Championships and was first in the Community College Division in Tucson Arizona, making the Collegiate All American Team. It has been a glorious uphill ride ever since. 
            I was invited that year to participate in the first ever Resident Athlete Program in Colorado Springs, Co. This was a defining moment in my archery career. As a team, we traveled all over the US to compete in tournaments in preparation of the Olympic Trials in 1988. 
            We also traveled to Europe to compete in two tournaments, one in France, with an 2nd place finish; and to Turkey at the 2nd Golden Arrow Tournament where I placed 7th in match play. We also traveled to Canada and shot in the 1988 Canadian Nationals, where I won the FITA, Field and Aggregate round in the guest division. Only two other people competing at that Nationals were ahead of me in all divisions, Chad Connor (Intermediate Guest) and Claude Rousseau (Canadian). I ended up 13th at the Olympic Trials that year and 7th overall at the US Outdoor Nationals in 1988.

We practice once a week as a club and encourage others to practice when they can. Our program provides coaching for all bow classes including: compound, recurve, Olympic recurve, barebow, and bow hunter. We help our members prepare for competing at a local, state, and national level. As archers improve within the club, they are awarded with pins to add to the JOAD ribbon which marks their improvement.</p>
